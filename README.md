# The Misa Project

## Introduction
AI has come quite a long way, and Alexa is pretty dumb comparatively. I want a smart voice assistant that can control my smarthome via Home Assistant integrations.

## [Step 1 - Home Assistant Setup](https://github.com/Nicolemp4/Home-Assistant-Setup)
The first step is to set up home assisntant itself. I had initially set up home assistant as a service running on my main server machine, a Dell Optiplex 5050 running Linux Mint.

## [Step 2 - Installing Ollama and Crafting a Personality](https://github.com/Nicolemp4/Ollama-Setup-and-Crafting-a-Personality)
After we have our smart home set up, we need an AI to connect it to. This will act as the brain of our voice assistant. I will be running Ollama locally with openhermes:v2.5.

## [Step 3 - Connecting Ollama to Home Assistant]()
Ollama and Openhermes will act essentially as the brain of Home Assistant's built in voice assistant framework. 

## [Step 4 - Home Assistant Setup (Again)]()
Realizing that I couldn't use addons with Home Assistant as an app was a setback for sure. This was not the first setback, but thankfully this one isn't too bad of a fix.

## [Step 5 - Connecting Ollama to Home Assistant]()
Now that Misa's brain is running on my windows machine and Home Assistant in running on the pi5.

## [Step 6 - Frustration]()
As it turns out, WSL cannot connect to the local network. At least not in a way I could make work.

## [Step 7 - Hardware]()
I had two choices ahead of me. Either Wipe my WIndows machine and set it up as a dedicated AI box, or upgrade the Optiplex. I opted for the latter.
